# Prediction of Number of Goals in Football

#### Build models and determine the accuracy (profit) of the model predicting the number of goals scored (under or over 2.5) in a football match in three top Championships of England, Italy and Spain.
### Introduction and Aim
Result is the most important thing in sports. In football, goals are a means of achieving results and goals scored are one of the most important tasks in a match.
